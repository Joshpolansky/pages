Euler. Euler.

Has anyone seen a good Euler angle calculator. Def not me. I can't promise this will be better, but at least I can find it.

It comes up a lot, especially with custom robotics. Everyone wants to use different conventions and figuring out if solutions match can be tricky. Maybe this will help, when I actually add it.
